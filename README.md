- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lohitasrith01
🌟 I'm a driven and detail-oriented Business Analytics graduate student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, passionate about leveraging data to solve complex problems and drive business decisions.

🔍 My academic and professional journey has equipped me with deep knowledge in machine learning, data analysis, and business intelligence. From developing predictive models that boast over 95% accuracy to optimizing supply chain networks for grocery distributions, my projects are where creativity meets functionality.

👨‍💻 With a robust technical toolkit that includes SQL, Python, R, and various BI tools, I thrive in environments that challenge my analytical and strategic thinking abilities. My hands-on experience spans across significant sectors, including finance, healthcare, retail, and more.

🚀 I'm on a mission to not only push the boundaries of what data can do but also to make it understandable and accessible for all stakeholders involved. Check out my repositories to see how I apply analytical rigor and innovative problem-solving to various datasets and scenarios.

📈 I believe in the power of data to transform industries and am always looking for the next challenging project or collaboration. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in connecting or discussing potential opportunities!
